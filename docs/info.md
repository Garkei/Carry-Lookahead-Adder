## How it works

A carry-lookahead adder is a type of adder designed for fast speeds. First, it calculates the propagate and generate signals. The propagate signal determines if a carry bit can propagate through to the next bit, and the generate signal bit determines if there is a carry bit. As the name implies, a carry-lookahead adder works by generating a carry bit for every bit in the sum. This works by determining every possible way a carry bit can be generated by combining the generate and propagate signal from previous bits. This process can be performed in a hierarchical, parallel manner by grouping the bits in the propagate and generate signals and performing addition on the larger group.

## How to test

ui_in[7:0] is addend 1, and uio_in[7:0] is addend 2. ui_out[7:0] is sum.

## External hardware

No external hardware needed
